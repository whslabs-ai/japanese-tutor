### GRAMMAR ANALYSIS:
#### **見えてきた (Miete kita)**  
1. **Pattern Recognition:**  
   This phrase combines the **te-form** of the verb **見える** (miete) with the auxiliary verb **来る** (kita). This pattern appears in **Genki 6 (て-form)** and is specifically discussed in later contexts for describing progression or continuation (e.g., Genki 19 when covering verbs of motion).  

2. **Pattern Structure:**  
   - Basic form: **V-て + 来る**  
   - Explanation: Indicates that an action or state has begun and is now progressing toward the present.  

3. **Examples:**  
   - 雨が降ってきた。  
     - *Literal:* The rain started and came.  
     - *Natural:* It has started raining.  
   - 冬が近づいてきた。  
     - *Literal:* Winter is approaching and coming.  
     - *Natural:* Winter is coming closer.  

4. **Pattern Analysis in Sentence:**  
   - **見えてきた**: "Has started becoming visible" - emphasizes the gradual process of the capital city entering view. It reflects a sense of progression rather than sudden visibility.  

5. **Nuances:**  
   This phrase often evokes imagery in storytelling contexts as it gradually draws attention, creating a cinematic-like effect of slowly "zooming in" on an important scene.  

#### **が**  
- **Grammar Note:** Marks **王都 (ōto)** as the subject of the sentence.  

#### **ね**  
- **Grammar Note:** Adds a sense of seeking agreement or confirmation, softening the statement and making it more listener-inclusive.

### COMMON MISTAKES:  
1. Using **見る** instead of **見える**:  
   - Incorrect: 王都を見るきた (major grammatical error).

2. Omitting the **が** particle:  
   - Learners sometimes drop particles, resulting in unclear subjects.

2. Explore fantasy or historical Japanese works to see **王都** in natural use cases.  
3. Use visualization exercises to connect **見える** with gradual processes of discovery.
